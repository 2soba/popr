In addition to storing JSON documents, you can also index them using the RediSearch module. This enables full-text search capabilities and document retrieval based on their content. To use this feature, you must install two modules: RedisJSON and RediSearch.

See [Indexing JSON](/docs/stack/search/indexing_json) to learn how to use RediSearch with RedisJSON.
